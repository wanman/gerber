Differences to Mediatomb (So far)

Rebranded as Gerbera, new Logo!
Actively maintained/developed.
Removed bundled libupnp - Now requires upstream 1.8 version.
Removed bundled libuuid.
Ported to CMake.
Enhanced cover art support for MP4, FLAC, Vorbis & WMA files (via TagLib).
TagLib handler opens files read only: stops inotify rescanning the dir on access causing "Object not found" see here.
Album folders have "creator" metadata (artist).
Album folders have artwork: either from external files or the tracks embedded artwork.
Per-track external art support: filename-of-track.jp\* (minus the audio file extension).
Removed libflac use/dep.
Remove libmp4v2 use/dep.
Remove id3lib use/dep.
Removed broken DVD image support (dvdnav).
IPv6 Support
Replaced SpiderMonkey (mozjs) dependency with embedded duktape engine.
WIP port to "Modern C++" / tidying.
Lots of other stuff.

Building

The project has been ported to CMake.

Install prerequisites.

On Ubuntu 16.04

apt-get install uuid-dev libexpat1-dev libsqlite3-dev libmysqlclient-dev \
libmagic-dev libexif-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
# If building with LibAV/FFmpeg (-DWITH_AVCODEC=1)
apt-get install libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavdevice-dev \
libavfilter-dev libavresample-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libpostproc-dev
The following packages are too old in 16.04 and must be installed from source: taglib (1.11.x), and libupnp (1.8.x).

libupnp must be configured/built with --enable-ipv6. See scripts/install-pupnp18.sh for details.

On FreeBSD

The following has bee tested on FreeBSD 11.0 using a clean jail environment.

Install the required prerequisites as root using either ports or packages. This can be done via Package manager or ports. (pkg manager is used here.) Include mysql if you wish to use that instead of SQLite3.
pkg install wget git autoconf automake libtool taglib cmake gcc libav ffmpeg libexif pkgconf liblastfm gmake
Clone repository, build depdences in current in ports and then build gerbera.
git clone https://github.com/v00d00/gerbera.git 
mkdir build
cd build
sh ../gerbera/scripts/install-pupnp18.sh
sh ../gerbera/scripts/install-duktape.sh
cmake ../gerbera -DWITH_MAGIC=1 -DWITH_MYSQL=0 -DWITH_CURL=1 -DWITH_JS=1 -DWITH_TAGLIB=1 -DWITH_AVCODEC=1 -DWITH_EXIF=1 -DWITH_LASTFM=0 -DWITH_SYSTEMD=0
make -j4
sudo make install
On macOS

The following has been tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.6

Install prerequisites using homebrew
Install ossp-uuid using homebrew
Install pupnp18 and duktape using the scripts provided.
Use the cmake option -DCMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK=LAST to avoid Clang linkage errors
Quick start build instructions:

git clone https://github.com/v00d00/gerbera.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../gerbera -DWITH_MAGIC=1 -DWITH_MYSQL=1 -DWITH_CURL=1 -DWITH_JS=1 \
-DWITH_TAGLIB=1 -DWITH_AVCODEC=1 -DWITH_FFMPEGTHUMBNAILER=1 -DWITH_EXIF=1 -DWITH_LASTFM=1
make -j4
sudo make install
Alternatively, the options can be set using a GUI (make sure to press "c" to configure after toggling settings in the GUI):

git clone https://github.com/v00d00/gerbera.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../gerbera
make edit_cache
# Enable some of the WITH... options
make -j4
sudo make install
